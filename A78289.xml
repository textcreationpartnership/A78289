            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But in time, the love that the King bore to the Father, was not comparable to that he had to the Daughter: But firſt it fell out, that the Ambitious Lady Meaga did conſture the Kings familiarity, with her Father, to be, becauſe the King was taken with her beauty; and then thought ſhe, if it be not, I wiſh it were ſo: And from theſe thoughts, ſhe fell to practice; for when the King came to Droomars houſe, which was near the Court, ſhe would trim her ſelf in glorious apparel, and adde Art to that Beauty ſhe had, and declares her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful love to an old Aunt of hers; whoſe bewitching</hi>

She ſeeing that her plot took ſo well applauding of her Aunts wiſdom, as ſhe termed it: But Meaga had a young Servant, whom ſhe had promiſed marriage, whoſe name was Sir Melker: but ſhe ſlighted him, and would ſcarce afford him any of her company, ſhe was ſo taken up with her great Captive: As ſhe called him to her Aunt, who by this time grew almoſt mad for love, or rather luſt; and courting her to yield to his deſire, ſhe did ſay, Truly, my Leige, I can grant nothing of that nature to the Emperor of the while World, who cannot be my husband. Therefore, continued ſhe, your Queen is the onely and ſole obſtable of your deſires, who by her loving ſpeeches, hath deluded your Majeſtie this many years; ſhe hath a Paramor that you know not of; Doth not young Cleocreton reſemble the Lord Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent?</hi>

               <hi>But, ſaid ſhe, while ſhould I diſcover this concerning my lawful Queen? but my great love to you, my Lord, doth make me go beyond my duty; for I cannot endure that you ſhould be called that, which your pooreſt Subjects hate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the Kings paſſion broke into a flame, and being always reſolute in any enterprize, therefore he would be ſatisfied, though it were both againſt the Laws of the Gods and men: Thus he ſucked up the bitter poyſon, that the old Witch, and the young Devil had prepared for him, and after wayed down with the ſweet cup of Meaga's ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gared words: And ſo cunning was ſhe, as when ſhe ſaid any thing againſt the Queen, we would even ſeem ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to declare what ſhe knew. But the King being three days from the Court, every one began to wonder at the Kings intimacy with the Earl of Drooma: Now the Lord Preſident, whoſe name was Cabulus, came to the Palace, with other Lords and Ladies of the City, to enquire how the Queen was in health; for it was told them, that ſhe was ſick; and indeed it was meerly through the unkinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe conceived at the Kings ſtay from her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the King in his wrath againſt his good Queen, and bewitched with love to this wicked Meaga, came home, and found matter enough for his jealouſie; for asking the ſervants who was with the Queen? they anſwered, the Lord Preſident: But he diſſembling the matter, came to the Queen; who ſeeing her Lord, roſe up (though not in health) and bowed to him. He ſeeing her indiſpoſition of body, never attributidg the cauſe from himſelf, but all his thought ruminating on what Meaga had told him, was rather ſubject to believe, that ſhe was breeding a childe, and ſtreight concluded it was begot by the Preſident: Thus was his minde bent to evil againſt his innocent Queen; for falſly ſmiling, he ſaid, Madam, you are but a breeding me another Son: Thus a while the King lived in languiſhment, ſo long as he was from Meaga.</hi>

At which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Queen fell ſick: But the wicked Meaga (the King continuing long from her) fearing that her baſe love would come to nought, was by her old Aunt, the hatcher of miſchief, promiſed a powerful effect: And it proved, thus, The Queen being better in health, the King commanded a ſhip to be finely trimed, wherein he did intend to take pleaſure on the Sea, with the Lord Preſident and Cleocre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, onely a woman or two of the Queens: But before they went, Meaga had procured inſtruments of miſchief like her ſelf; for the King examining his Servants and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks concerning the jealouſie he had of his Queen, though ſuch things were far from any of their heads, for they and all others, knew her modeſt life: Therefore ſaid the King (when all he ſaid was to no purpoſe) in a fury, You are all of a conſpiracy, and one day will cut me ſhort, by that wicked woman my wives inſtigati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Well, the King hearing this, and knowing of Meaga's Villains that ſhe had prepared for the buſineſs, therefore he went even then into the ſhip with Cabulus, and the Queen with Cleocreton; but they had forgot young For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, of whom you ſhall afterwards hear: But the King did not forget to cauſe the Raſcally rude Rogues to follow them in another ſhip. So when the Royal ſhip had now lanced into the deep, with the other cloſe by it, the King began to ſay, What Cabulus thinks thou, ſhall I have another Son, my wife ſeems to threaten me: At which the Queen ſmiled innocently, and ſaid, It may be ſo my Lord, ſooner then I know of, but the Queen meant another way. Then ſaid the Preſident, I wiſh your Majeſtie had many ſuch Sons as theſe two you have. I, ſaid the King, ſo would I, but not of your getting, as this is; and with that, he thruſt Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creton from him. The Queen and Lord Cabulus ſtood amazed, to hear theſe words from the King.

            </p>
            <p>Then ſaid <hi>Albyazer, For my ſhare, I am intrapped by the gins and ſnares of a powerful Beauty, as I could wiſh I had always remained as free, as you profels your ſelf. But,</hi> ſaid <hi>Cleocreton, I pray Sir, what may that Beauty be, that hath dominion over ſuch a brave ſpirit as yours? I hope you may diſcover your diſeaſe, it is not infections. Sir,</hi> replyed <hi>Albyazer, Your own eyes ſhall be Judges, no other then the Lady Philopeet, whoſe beauty you know, and whoſe perfections are ſcarce to be parallel'd: This Lady is Neece to the King of Corinth, her Father dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two years ago, and he being a great Companion with the Emperor my Uncle; ſo theſe two dearly loving one another, and the Lady her Mother loſing her life, by giving of breath to Philopeet, her Father left the Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of her to the Emperor of Perſia; though it did a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtomack the King of Corinth her Uncle, who had no childe: But no ſooner did I ſee the Lady, but ſtreight I had an invincible love for her: But though ſo fair, yet ſo rigorous is ſhe, as the truth is, I am very unhappy. She ſo much reſembleth the Diamond, that though the moſt beautiful, yet the hardeſt of any ſtone: At the firſt ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained me very ſweetly for a friend, but in the quality of a ſervant, even as I have told you. Cleocreton</hi> could not but ſmile, to ſee with what a concerned look and action he did declare his love, and thought himſelf bleſſed to be free from ſuch a diſtraction, as diſturbed the hearts of the braveſt men</p>
            <p>But while they were talking of love, there came to the

               <hi>for your Noble deeds, ſo ſhall you loſe nothing of your honor and reſpect here, onely give your oath not to depart hence without leave from my ſelf.

            <p>Then they all returned whom to their lodgings, but poor <hi>Cleocreton</hi> was in the ſadeſt caſe of them all; for he was

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:153076:15"/>
               <hi>finde, in the Univerſe, can bring me content, hut Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creton, who I fear hath no affection at all for me. Now tell me, didſt thou ever behold a more accompliſhed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then this young Prince? Julia</hi> well perceiving what ground this growing paſſion had gained of her Lady, thought that nothing would do but compliance: and therefore ſaid, <hi>Madam, how is it poſſible but he ſhould have a great affection to you; for I think I did ſee you both, when your hearts were ſmitten with love, and I'll ſware he did gaze upon your beauty ſo much, as I am very much miſtaken if he have not a moſt paſſionate love for you. But, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, if you would have the credit of the cauſe, chear up your Spirits, and to morrow let me attire you to all the advantage that may be, and you, ſhall preſently perceive whether it be ſoor no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Well Julia</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>thou wouldſt make me believe ſtrange things, but I am not ſo credulous; for I have often heard, that Lovers have much difficulty, and much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ſhall I think to be happy at the firſt? For if Cleocreton did love Cloriana, that were not all; for then my Father how incenſed would he be: But if that were all my diſtreſs, I ſhould bear it well enough, but it is the want of love, that will, I fear, be the cauſe of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. Well Madam</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>then I hope you need not complain; for there muſt needs be a ſimpathy in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture between two that are ſo incomparable you are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Diſcourſe was broken off by the coming in of the Emperor and all the Ladies, to viſit <hi>Cloryana:</hi> for one of her maids being asked of the Empreſs concerning her: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that <hi>Cloryana</hi> was awake; and no ſooner knew the Emperor, but needs muſt he ſee his chief and onely darling. So coming in, <hi>Iulia</hi> went to the door, and ſeeing the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, went and told <hi>Cloryana,</hi> who was in far better temper then ſhe was. So he placing himſelf on the bed ſide, and all the Ladies on ſeats, he ſaid to her, <hi>what is thy Melady, my Cloryana.</hi> She ſmiling ſaid, <hi>A little ſleep hath cured me, my Lord.</hi> Then ſaid the Empreſs, <hi>Childe, if thou be well, I</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:153076:15"/>
               <hi>would have thee riſe.</hi> And ſo they departing the room, <hi>clory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> got up, and very pleaſantly ſaid, <hi>come Iulta, lets ſee thy charms now, that thou wilt arm me withal, to take a heart Priſoner.</hi> So <hi>cloryana</hi> was very gloriouſly apparalled, in a Gown of green and ſilver, which beſt ſuited with the ſeaſon, and ſhe affected to be attired the moſt like a ſhepherdeſs, with her head adorned in flowers of divers colours, and intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Diamonds, and having her garment claſped down before with Diamonds und Rubies, the ſleeves being open, hung looſe, and were as long as the reſt of her gown, and over her lovely hair, hung a vail of white, ſpreading over her ſhoulders, her fair alablaſter neck ſhewing it ſelf thorow it, with her rich and coſtly bracelets, and chains of pearls. In the mean time was <hi>cleocreton</hi> diſcovering himſelf to <hi>Galta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet,</hi> and he was very ſorroy for his dear Maſters diſquiet, and promiſed him all the aid and aſſiſtance that he could make him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Galtazet,</hi> ſaid <hi>Cleocreton, what ſhall I do to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my love to her, that is the cauſe of it. Well, my Lord,</hi> ſaid <hi>Galtazet, if you will for this once be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled by your ſervant, do but write your Princely chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to the Lady, and I will dye, or bring you an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. cleocreton</hi> was glad to hear him ſay ſo, for he knew that his notable wit, would bring forth any enterprize that he took in hand: So he went and writ a Letter to <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So we will leave him to his writing, and take notice what news the Queen hath received from <hi>Hungary.</hi> A meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger having brought her a packet of Letters, and a pretty ſum of gold, from the good Lady the Preſidents wife, whoſe name was <hi>Queama:</hi> Who when ſhe had received the ſad tidings of her husbands death, and of the ſtrange baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Queen, having at that time in her cuſtody young Prince <hi>Fortus,</hi> conveyed him ſecretly to her Countrey houſe, whoſe weak ſoul was ſo tranſported, without meaſure, that the Lady could ſcarce keep him from being diſcovered: but he had a great love to <hi>Queama,</hi> for ſhe was his nurſe, and had a ſon of his age, and very like him: ſo the Lady ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way her ſon to a brothers of hers, and by that means was <hi>Fortus</hi> preſerved in the room, and under the name of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:153076:16"/>
ſon, whoſe name was <hi>Steafea.</hi> So this vertuous Widow, though her Husband loſt his life for the Queen, yet ſhe ſtill retained her old love towards her: And hearing that her Maieſty was in <hi>Perſia,</hi> went and acquainted the Queens friends thereof, and ſo amongſt them, they ſent her a ſum of moneys, and alſo to let her know, that ſhe was their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Queen, and they her lawful Subiects, and that they would venture their lives for her: and alſo, that the King they thought, would be ſoon weary of his proud, inſulting Concubine, who did not onely ſtrive to diſtreſs the Quéens friends, but alſo to govern the King, and all the Kingdom. The Queen hearing this news, preſently acquanted her good friends the Emperor and Empereſs vvi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h it, for it vvas no ſmall Ioy to her, to hear ſhe had ſuch good Subiects. But the Prince <hi>Fortus</hi> writ to his brother Prince <hi>Cleocreton, That if he would gain honor, then muſt he come where it was to be had; deſiring him to come to Hungary, and ſee if either by whiles or force, they could rout the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Meaga out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which news was not very pleaſant to the Queen: for ſhe dreaded to part with her other Son alſo, but at the laſt ſhe conſented that he ſhould go within two moneths: but ſo did not ſweet <hi>Cloryana</hi> for ſhe loſt all her hopes, if her ſervant went away, before there was ſome diſcovery of their love. But for all this news, <hi>Cleocreton</hi> continued to adore her Shrine, above all the Kingdoms of the World: and when he had writ his Letter he gave it to <hi>Galtazet,</hi> which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe:</p>

            <p>Now there was to be a general Feaſt and Banquet at the Emperors Palace, for the Lords and Ladies of the Court; for it was the Emperors Birth-day, and every one appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their ſundry coſtly Apparel.</p>
            <p>And when the were all placed, every Lover feaſted more on their Ladies beauty, then any entertainment that could be imagined. <hi>Cleocreton</hi> gladly, but wifely, beholding <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryana,</hi> for it was death to him he thougth, to be diſcovered: but <hi>Cloryana</hi> could by no means hide her bluſhing for though ſhe diſſembled her ſelf, and looked at any thing elſe, yet ſtill ſhe muſt ſometimes ſteal a ſight of her <hi>Cleocreton,</hi> who did the ſame for her: but ſhe ſitting next <hi>Calſey,</hi> and they two having a little diſcourſe, <hi>Cloryana</hi> had a great deal of love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her: for ſhe was of ſo true a diſpoſition, that in any thing, that poſſibly ſhe could, ſhe would favour her friend: and all people did honor her, but eſpecial <hi>Muxorb,</hi> whoſe eyes did cloſely follow her looks. <hi>Calſey</hi> ſeeing <hi>Cloryana</hi> very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to bluſh, and knowing well what Love meant, did ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine her to be affected with ſome that was preſent: and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Cleocreton</hi> ſtealing his looks on her, and viewing him, and ſeeing his great worth and noble preſence, thought, <hi>why may it not be that with him my Coſin Cloryana is in love.</hi> And taking her by the hand, ſaid, <hi>Coſin, methinks Prince Cleocreton is a very Noble, fine Perſon. Cloryana,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:153076:18"/>
bluſhing more then before, ſaid to <hi>Calſey, I Coſin, it is pity he ſhould be croſſed in his Fortunes ſo much, for he hath a very vertuous Mother. Calſey</hi> could not but ſaule to ſee <hi>Cloryana's</hi> hand ſhake, and tremble, as ſhe ſpake, but let her alone for that time, and thought to get it out ſome other way.</p>
            <p>But when they had ended their entertainment, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror deſired they ſhould dance, and having as: excellent mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick as the World could afford, he went himſelf to the Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> to take her out: She would fain have refuſed it, but that ſhe knew it would affront the Emperors kindeneſs, but ſhe very gallantly performed her part: the Emperor took alſo the fair Empreſs, and ſhe very ſpritely, and moſt becomingly danced, <hi>Cleocreton</hi> took <hi>Cloryana</hi> through courſe, and ſhe did ſo nimbly and delicately dance one while in the French mode, and another while in the Perſian faſhion; and Prince <hi>Cleocreton</hi> was not to ſeek: for indeed they were ſo rarely matched, as theſe two did ſhade away all the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the company: there was none that could in the leaſt come near her, but onely a Noble Lady of the Court, whoſe name was <hi>Trandia,</hi> whom the Lord <hi>Muxorb,</hi> after he had taken <hi>Calſey,</hi> he led her out, and they did both admirably well, though <hi>Cloryana</hi> carried the day of her.</p>
            <p>But now it was time for every one to go to their reſt. But <hi>Cleocreton</hi> had warned <hi>Galtazet</hi> to court <hi>Iulia</hi> by any means to get entrance into her Ladies Chamber, for that was the privateſt place they could méet in. So <hi>Iulia</hi> ſaid, as ſoon as ſhe could ſpeak with her Lady, <hi>Good Madam, grant me one requeſt, and that is, that you would let Prince Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creton</hi> come and ſpeak with you to night. Nay <hi>Julia,</hi> I muſt not give him that liberty. For we two to be alone with him, I ſhall not endure it, and company thou knoweſt is dangerous, and beſides, my Coſin <hi>Calſey</hi> muſt be with me to night. Why Madam <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> are you ſo far from ſatisfying one, whom you have confeſſed often to me; that you loved above all the World.

We need not, ſaid Trulious, let her ſpeak, and condem whom ſhe pleaſes. He then attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her anſwer, ſhe ſaid, There hath none any right to Trandia but Truilous. Well, ſaid Caſtore, ſince I muſt dye by your condemnation, Madam, my fall ſhall be with the blood of Trulious; and with that he gave him a very mortal wound on his ſide. Trulious at the receiving of this wound, was almoſt dead but yet recovering himſelf, he gave him another on the thigh, and after that, laid on ſtrokes incredible for one ſo fore wounded; while poor Trandia crying, and threatning, and promiſing great things to Caſtore, to leave the fight; but all her tears and entreaties was to no purpoſe, for fight they did, till they both fell down to the ground. She running to Trulious, and finding that he did breath, cauſed him to be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into her coach, and away they haſted to the next Town: But O Heavens, how grievouſly ſhe lamented the ſad fortune of her dear Trulious! who by his groans and ſighs did give his ſummons to death, while ſhe ſpent herſelf with dolorous and heavy complaints. At the laſt, while he was in her arms, he faintly ſaid, Now my dear Trandia farewel, the Gods make thee more happy in thy ſecond love, then thou haſt been in thy firſt: And ſo lifting up his head to kiſs her, and ſo breathed his laſt breath in her mouth: She ſeeing him dead, could not contain her ſorrows, but burſted forth a weeping, and lamenting, and kiſing the dead body, ſhe fell on her face, and ſaid, I come my dear Trulious, and ſo fell into a ſwound; her two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men uſing all their art and induſtry for her recovery, and filling the aire with their crys, and not ſuffering their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs to depart, ſhe came to her ſelf juſt as they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring</hi>

She always was her Counſellour before, and therefore ſhe hearkned to her; and ſo cauſing the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be buried (after many entreaties) and cloathing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and her Servants in mourning, ſhe took her way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Perſia: And having uttered many ſad Complaints, ſhe conſidered that it was the beſt way for her, not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover herſelf to her friends, becauſe it was not known to any in the place where ſhe was going.</hi>

But good Salliman was extreme ſorrowful to ſee his daughters reſerved temper: for all the invenſion he had, or that he and her mother could deviſe, would ſcarce cauſe a laugh from her: Then they reſolving to try all ways with her, went abroad, and came to the Court, where they ſtayed a while: And one night (as ſhe was in her uſual lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) there appeared the ſpirit of her Trulious, and ſaid unto her, O Trandia, leave thy weeping, for thereby thou tormenteſt my ſoul, and ſo vaniſhed. She durſt not mourn then, but ſtriving as much as ſhe could to comfort her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, at the laſt, with much ado, ſhe became as pleaſant as any Lady at the Court, and then her beauty appeared as bright as ever: And there was then with the Emperor, one of his chief Lords of his Counſel, that fell in love with her, and married her.</hi>

Theſe and the like fancies made <hi>Cleocreton</hi> to look pale for want of ſleep.</p>
            <p>The next day, ſaid <hi>Albyazer</hi> to him, and ſmiled, <hi>Methinks you have the wan look of a Lover, my Lord.</hi> Whereat he bluſhed, and fearing to be diſcovered, as it is the cuſtom of Lovers to fear that ſometimes which is moſt impoſſible. <hi>Come my Conquerer (ſaid the incomparable Muxorb) be not aſhamed to be like your friends. Well (ſaid Cleocreton) when I am in love, I will tell you all. Truly, my Lord, (ſaid Albyazer to Muxorb) if you had but heard how Prince Cleocreton reviled love, you would have had no patience.

               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:153076:23"/>
was very glad that ſhe might enjoy her Princely ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant a while longer: Whereat <hi>Cleocreton</hi> with a great deal of reverence, kill the hand of his Lady, and ſo had her good night. Now they both thought it very convenient, that he ſhould diſcover his affections to the Quéen his Mother, for the better carrying on of their deſign<hi>:</hi> So in the morning, before the time of ſport, <hi>Cleocreton</hi> went to the Quéens Chamber, and told her the meſſage that the Emperor ſent him; and he was naturally unwilling to diſcover the ſnare he was fallen into, and ſtood mute: yet thinking that he muſt not neglect that which would be any advantage to his love, and alſo that it was the pleaſure of the Lady of his life; the Quéen taking notice of his earneſt ſtudy, ſmiled, ſaying, <hi>Well, Cleocreton, Lovers uſe to muſe; but thou art not one, how comeſt thou to be ſo ſtrangly ſtupified?</hi> He hearing her ſpeak ſo, thought it good to take occaſion by her ſpéech, to diſcover himſelf, ſaying. <hi>In love Madam; if I were ſo, would you oppoſe it? I would (ſaid ſhe) if were it not a perſon of merit and quality. Nay, then I am right (ſaid he) for I know there is none ſo worthy as ſhe. Then ſhe is too high for us Son (ſaid the Queen.

            </p>
            <p>The Quéen ſighed and ſaid, <hi>Alas, what hope is there, though ſhe do love thee, yet will not the Emperor match his onely Daughter to a Prince baniſhed, not onely out of his Kingdom, but robbed of his right for ever. Well, fear not Madam (ſaid he) but that in a ſhort time I ſhall bring or ſend you good news from Hungary: But good Mother, I entreat you to let the Princes enjoy your company, for ſhe doth greatly deſire your favour. I, but (ſaid the Queen) how can I be privy to all this, and not ſeem a deceiver to the Emperor, whoſe kindeneſs I ſhall abuſe, by advancing my own deſigns, without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge.</hi>

               <hi>Cleocreton</hi> hearing his Mothers words, fell down on his knées, and ſaid, <hi>Deplorable is my condition; for I muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have my ſweet Cloryana, or dye: Nor ſhall all the Emperors in the World keep the ſweet Cioryana from me; for ſhe vouchſafeth to love me, by which I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to gain her with my deareſt blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Quéen hearing her Sons paſſion, and knowing the power of love, ſhe ſought to reclaim him with perſwaſions; but ſéeing all her Rhetorick was to no purpoſe, but rather made him more violent, &amp; ſhe having a tender heart towards her ſon (for there was no vertue that ſhe was not poſſeſſed of) ſhe ſaid, <hi>Since I muſt, Cleocreton, conſent to thee, thou haſt my free conſent; and I ſhall be glad to have the eſteem of ſo noble a Lady as Cloryana. Cleocreton</hi> humbly thanked his mother.</p>
            <p>And by this time the Liſts began to be entred by the young Knights of the Court; the Emperor, with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and ſweet <hi>Cloryana,</hi> by her was ſet <hi>Calſey,</hi> and on the other ſide was the Quéen of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Philopeet,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them was placed all the young Ladies of the Court, all placed on rich cuſhions, and they attended the ſports of Tilting, and the Turnaments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleoereton</hi> appeared in gréen Armour, varniſhed and enamel'd with gréen and ſilver, and in it one might ſée the cunningneſs of the Workman, in repreſenting a clear Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and in it little Fiſhes, leaping and ſporting, as though it were real; and on the banks was a Shepherdeſs of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable beauty, flying up to a Garden of divers pretty ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that grew beſide her on the gréen banke: His Motto was,</p>

            </q>
            <p>His Horſe was of a light Bay, and all his Trappings and Furniture was of gréen and Silver, like the reſt. But no ſooner did <hi>Cloryana</hi> ſee him, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:153076:24"/>
in Armour of Aſh colour and flowered with red, as it look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more like ſilks then ſteel. The Motto was this,</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Beauty claims the Victory.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Philopeet</hi> to her pleaſure, beheld her recovered <hi>Albyazer</hi> in Armour, being of the ſame that he had before, for he came but even hen the Iuſts began, and ſo was not ſo well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided: But ſuddenly the ſports began, and breaking their Spears very nimbly, and ſome being tumbled off their Horſes, drew their Swords, through anger to be diſgraced, even before the eyes of their La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ies, hoping thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge their injuries, and recover their loſt glory, with their following valour; but the Emperor perceiving it, called and commanded, that they ſhould put up their Swords, and ſaid, <hi>Gentlemen, you ſhall ſhed no blood here, but ſtay, and I will ſend you the Pictures of all the Ladies of my Court that hath beauty, and break your Spears in the honor of your Ladies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Portraictures of the Ladies was firſt preſented to <hi>Albyazer,</hi> who did very courteouſly give <hi>Cleocreton</hi> the choice, he taking <hi>Cloryana,</hi> and himſelf <hi>Philopeet, Muxorb</hi> took <hi>Calſey,</hi> and then according to their ſeveral qualities, the reſt took their choice. Lord <hi>Cranor</hi> took Lady <hi>Vincy</hi> Lord <hi>Rophet</hi> took Lady <hi>Pleama,</hi> young <hi>Criſpus</hi> took <hi>Oney,</hi> and all the reſt took choice according to their intereſts and affection. But thus was it ordered, that he that conquered, the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed ſhould reſign his Portraicture to him that conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</p>
            <p>The Lady <hi>Pleama's</hi> beauty, as it was excellent, ſo her Servant defe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ded it valiantly, and carried the prize of thrée Pictures, doing homage to <hi>Pleama's</hi> beauty; but <hi>Cleocre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> diſdained that any ſhould bear the prize of beauty, though it was the more inferior prize; for he allowed none at all to any but the Pearleſs Princeſs <hi>Cloryana;</hi> therefore couching his Spear he ran with ſuch violence, as he cauſed both horſe and man on their knées, not onely to do homage to the beauty of <hi>Cloryana,</hi> but alſo to the horſe feet of <hi>Cleocreton,</hi> and ſo he loſt all. Now <hi>Cleocreton</hi> had got a great many Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traictures, and <hi>Albyazer</hi> and <hi>Muxorb</hi> had conquered all the reſt; but onely Lord <hi>Craner,</hi> who did ſtoutly reſiſt, for he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:153076:24"/>
had met with his equal, and they did ſo long continue, till at the laſt his Enemy gave up his Portraictuee, he being conſtrained thereto; and ſo Lord <hi>Craner</hi> had got other three beſides his own, but <hi>Cleocreton</hi> quickly diſpatched him, and ſent him grieving amongſt the reſt, not onely for their loſs, but alſo their diſgrace.</p>
            <p>Now all ſéemed vanquiſhed but the three Conquerers, Prince <hi>Cleocreton,</hi> Prince <hi>Albyazer,</hi> and Lord <hi>Muxorb;</hi> but there came a Servant of the Lady <hi>Calſeys</hi> into the Liſt, and hearing that <hi>Muxorb</hi> did claim priviledge to her by her Picture, came and produced her Picture but <hi>Muxorb</hi> ſoon eſpying his Ladies Portraicture, the which the Emperor did not beſtow, he ſtraight may ſpurred on with indignation, and thirſt of glory, ran at the valiant <hi>Haimerei,</hi> who did excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well defend his Ladies beauty againſt her beauty; but he that had the moſt love from the Beauty, gained the Beauty, and ſo away rid <hi>Muxorb</hi> with his Ladies Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture, and when he came they were all vanquiſhed. But <hi>Muxorb</hi> thought, that though the honor of the day was great, yet that honor divided among thrée, was but little; ſo he proud of his laſt Conqueſt, thought to try his fortune with one of the Princes.</p>
            <p>So going to <hi>Albyazer,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Come, win my ſix prizes from me.</hi> He would not refuſe it, but rather was as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as <hi>Muxorb:</hi> Then did they go together, and many offences and defences, blinde Fortune gave <hi>Muxorb</hi> the Victory, to the grief of <hi>Philopeet,</hi> that had no great eſteem on <hi>Calſey:</hi> But for all that, ſhe thought herſelf a little reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if one may call it ſo, to ſée her Enemy fall by himſelf; for Fortune was <hi>Cleocretons</hi> friend alwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:153076:25"/>
               <hi>ye would get no Honor by that; and yet love hath ſuch effects, as to cauſe them that are poſſeſſed with it, to imagine their ſnares to be laid by the hands of the moſt accompliſhed Beauties, therefore it ſhall not be ſaid, that I will not venture all my ſtrength, and the other prizes, for the Lady I account ſo: But if you do remain Victor, let me keep theſe two, that I may not loſe her eſteem. Content,</hi> ſaid <hi>Cleocreton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With that they bravely advanced their Spears, and ran one upon another. <hi>Muxorb</hi> gave <hi>Cleocreton</hi> a round ſalute over his Helmet, and he nimbly paid him in his own coyn; then <hi>Muxorb</hi> reſolved to try his utmoſt, and bending all his force, ſtruck <hi>Cleocreton</hi> almoſt out of his ſaddle; but <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creton</hi> grew angry to be ſo long debating a thing, that all the World muſt néeds yield it to be his right; and alſo knowing, that it was not the cuſtom of Conquerors, to be long in conquering, he preſently gave <hi>Muxorb</hi> the foil; and then the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> imbraced each other, and he delivered to <hi>Cleocre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> all the Pictures, onely that of <hi>Calſey.</hi> And being almoſt loaded with the number of them, the Emperor ſéeing it, ſaid, <hi>In earneſt, Prince Cleocreton, you will carry all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor away from my Perſian Knights. If it be diſhonor to your Majeſties Knights (ſaid Cleocreton) yet doth the Honor reſt to you ſtill in the Princeſs Cloryana, whoſe Beauty hath made me invincible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Emperor eſpying <hi>Cloryana's</hi> Pourtraicture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and the higheſt of them all, ſaid, <hi>Truly Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I did not intend yours for one; but ſince it is ſo, take your Coronet from your head, and therewith Crown the Conqueror.</hi> She with a modeſt bſuſh, obeyed her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Crowned the Temples of her beloved <hi>Cleocreton:</hi> which did certainly preſage, that ſhe alone muſt ſet the Crown of <hi>Perſia</hi> on his head. He moſt humbly kiſt the Princeſs hand, and reverently bowed to them all, and ſo went from her; the Quéen his Mother well noting with what willingneſs ſhe gave, and he received; But infinite praiſe and acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did all the Perſian people throw continually on <hi>Cleocre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> noble valour in any enterprize.</p>
            <p>But the worthy <hi>Cleocreton</hi> thought no honor, like the laſt that the Emperor conferred on him, to cauſe <hi>Cloryana</hi> to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:153076:25"/>
Crown him; whoſe beautions ſelf he preferred before all the Kingdoms and Crowns in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philopeet</hi> was highly diſpreaſed, that her beauty would be foiled by <hi>Cloryana,</hi> and <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſey</hi> likewiſe, for it was inſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, ſhe always having the greateſt conceit of her own, above others.</p>
            <p>But for <hi>Cloryana,</hi> ſhe was ſatisfied, that ſhe onely ſhould have the prize of Beauty from all the World. The Ladies did clearly ſee <hi>Calſeys</hi> diſcontent. Whereupon ſaid <hi>Cloryana, Coſin Calſey, thou art alſo troubled that Cleocreton ſhould conquer thy Muxorb.</hi> But poor Lady, ſhe ſeemed as if ſhe was not at all troubled, and ſaid, <hi>Truly Coſin, if he had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured any thing elſe but my beauty, pardon me, if I wiſhed his honor above all the Princes on earth; but ſince he went about ſo unprofitable a thing, as my beauty, I cannot grieve at all; for in my conceit, that was the onely thing that made him be vanquiſhed. But, dear Madam, if I were proud of my beauty, then have I mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough, in being ſeated next you, that have the choice name of beauty in the World. Well Calſey (ſaid Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryana) thou canſt flatter fairly; but I know it is thy love that makes the erre, and have more eſteem of poor Clory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana then ſhe deſerves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the great care of our two Lovers, is, to take their ſecret farewel of one another: They had ſome diſcourſe that they did not expect, for the Emperor would needs take the pleaſure of a walk in the evenin. So they all went but the ſolitary Queen of <hi>Hungary:</hi> The Emperor led his fair Empreſs, and after her went her moſt incomparable Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, led by Prince <hi>Cleocreton,</hi> and after them <hi>Albyazer</hi> with <hi>Philopeet,</hi> and then went the other Lovers, <hi>Muxorb</hi> and <hi>Calſey.</hi> The Emperor and Empreſs was applauding <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretons</hi> worth and Princely demeanor, and all the reſt in their ſeveral diſcourſes: <hi>Cleocreton</hi> and his ſweet Princeſs was altogether taken up with the ſad diſcourſe of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Perſia, O (ſaid he) how ſhould I do, my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Princeſs, if ſome great match ſhould be offered the Emperor your Father for you, and I far diſtant, and not at Perſia to diſpute with him. Well, my Cleocreton (ſaid</hi>

            </p>

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>She now inſenſibly touched with grief to part with him, and alſo to ſee his grief, her eyes guſhing out tears, which

diſtilled down her vermillion Chéeks, like an <hi>April</hi> ſhowre on a fair Sky-light, careleſly expoſed to the weather, ſhe ſaid, <hi>The Gods make but Cleocreton as fortunate for ever, as he hath been at Perſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calſey</hi> by this time was gotten up, for they both lay toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhe and <hi>Muxorb</hi> was a little high in their terms; for there was ſomething that ſhe took unkindely, and reproving him ſharply, at the law they were good friends: And then he kiſſing her a thouſand times, ſaid, <hi>Well, it ſhall not be long ere I ſee thee again, dear Calſey.</hi> Then he left her hardly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of her loſs, but afterwards, poor Lady, comes her ſorrow.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Cleocreton</hi> often going back to his <hi>Cloryana,</hi> but at law they muſt part: Then ſhedding a ſhowre of tears, which even moved the heart of <hi>Julia</hi> to wéep alſo, in came <hi>Calſey:</hi> then <hi>Cleocreton</hi> taking her by the hand, ſaid, <hi>Good Madam, be careful of my Princeſs,</hi> and ſaluting her, went to have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kiſs of <hi>Cloryana,</hi> but went immediately forth, for fear that he ſhould have béen forced to have returned again. So they departed, and <hi>Albyazer</hi> rode a little way with them, and then parted from them.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Cleocreton</hi> and <hi>Muxorb</hi> went together ſome miles, till they took ſhipping, then parted they. <hi>Cleocreton</hi> ſailed very ſadly towards <hi>Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Muxorb</hi> as full of mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Cleocreton</hi> came to the houſe of the good Lady <hi>Queamas,</hi> who reio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ced to ſée the Prince, and to hear of the welfare of the Quéen his Mother. Young <hi>Fortus,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Strata,</hi> was a hunting: Then <hi>Cleocreton</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Galtazet</hi> to go tell his Brother, that he was there. Then <hi>Galtazet</hi> went and found <hi>Strata,</hi> and rid by, to ſée whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the young Prince would know him or no; but no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vvas <hi>Galtazet</hi> haſtned by, but <hi>Strata</hi> turned his horſe, and galoped after him, ſaying, <hi>What, Galtazet, is it thee.</hi> Then he bovved, and told him, that his Brother <hi>Cleocreton</hi> vvas at his houſe, and that his Mother the Quéen vvas vvell,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:153076:28"/>
and that ſhe had ſent him a pretty Ievvel, vvhich he gave him: Then <hi>Strata</hi> haſted away, and left the ſport to the reſt of his Companions; and alighting and ſeeing his Brother, they embraced each other, and with glad hearts asked one another of all the paſſages that they knew; which <hi>Cleocreton</hi> did alſo, but omitting that of his love to <hi>Cloryana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Strata</hi> told <hi>Cleocreton,</hi> that <hi>Meaga</hi> had baniſhed the love of almoſt all the Kings Subjects by her oppreſſion, and that ſhe had born the King thrée Sons, and was grown ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in her wickedneſs, that ſhe thought never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; and that there was gathered together a head of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and their chief was one <hi>Crenopher,</hi> and the next to him was <hi>Meaga's</hi> Father, the Earl of <hi>Drooma;</hi> who foretelling her, that great miſery would befal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> her, if ſhe did not reſign her place to the lawful Quéen of <hi>Hungary;</hi> ſhe ſhe inſolently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>Keep your doting Propheſie, for them that will give you thanks for it; I will make you know, that I am you Soveraign.</hi> So ſhe being touched to the quick, would not ſpare her own Father, but cauſed the King to take his Eſtate from him, but took her Wicked Mother and Slut to her. And thus was the Court of <hi>Hungary</hi> furniſhed with rare gueſts, while in the mean time the poor Earl being troubled in his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for his Daughters ſin, and having no maintenance, turned utter foe to the King, and his own Houſhold, and was amongſt the Rebels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleocreton</hi> bearing his Fathers diſtreſs, through his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects hate, that before was of an accounted the moſt Loyal: therefore he would go (as nature bound him) and cool the heat of the Rebels: But <hi>Strata</hi> ſaid, <hi>Brother, why ſhould we fight againſt our friends, and for the wicked Mega. I</hi> (ſaid <hi>Garnes) but where is our natural affections, if we do not relieve our Father in his diſtreſs; and for her, let her puniwment be by ſome other: And brother, fear not, But the Gods will look on the afflictions of our vertuous Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With this reſolution the vertuous Prince went in amongſt his Fathers Enemies, and firſt obſerving which was the Quéens friends, they fell on the other like Lightning, and, made ſuch a great breach upon them with their two ſword so that all them that were left, with great admiration, callee them gods, that were come in the perſons men, to revengd their Treaſon. But their natural Prince <hi>Cleocreton,</hi> did not delight to ſhed the blood of his Fathers Subjects, and therefore ſaid, with a high voyce, <hi>Friends, what are your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:153076:28"/>
               <hi>to abuſe your ſelves thus, in rebelling againſt your Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord.</hi> One of the head of them, which was <hi>Crenopon,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Our oppreſſions are great, by reaſon of the wicked Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot; our hate extends not to our King, but againſt her. Well,</hi> ſaid <hi>Cleocreton, perſiſt not in your practices, but come and I will beg your pardom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They then thought it was the beſt courſe ſo do, and ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in token of agréeing to what he ſaid. Then he going near the King, kneeling down, ſaid, <hi>Your Majeſties Subjects craves pardon for their paſt faults.</hi> The King would not let ſay any more, but took him up, and preſently gave them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, for he himſelf was a witneſs what wonders they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and by inſpiration had reſpect for them, though be knew them not. Therefore he ſaid, <hi>Let me know the men that have ſaved my life.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Cleocreton</hi> and <hi>Fortis</hi> took off their Helmets, and kneeled down to their Father: The King then knew full well, that they were his two Sons, and was grieved in his thoughts that he had treated them ſo fair, and ſhewn them ſo much kindeneſs, for he déemed them no better then Baſtards; yet he ſaid, <hi>Come, Baſtard Sons muſt have portions, though not Kingdoms. Well, my Lord</hi> ſaid <hi>Cleocreton) I would to the Gods you had lived as vertuous a life as the Queen our Mother, then had not your Majeſtie harboured ſo baſe a Concubine, and thrown forth your lawful and vertuous Wife: But know, that though ſhe is not in Hungary, yet doth ſhe in health live in Perſia, and wiſhes you health, my Lord, notwithſtanding all your harſhneſs to her: And I adde this, that your Majeſtie ſhall well ſee, that the King of Tunis will prove his Siſter worthy and vertuous, and then you will be glad to take the Vengeance of your Harlot with patience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King in anger roſe, and called to the Guard to clap them up. But they ſaid, <hi>Not ſo, my Lord they that ſaved your life, will not Juffer their own to be taken away;</hi> and ſo making their way with their ſwords, they broke thorow the midſt of them: And when they were got from the throng of their Enemies, they looked behinde them, hearing and ſéeing <hi>Meaga</hi> commanding the Souldiers to purſue them, but none would obey her; for they feared the valour of the two young Princes.</p>
            <p>Then they went and lodged at Lady <hi>Queama's</hi> houſe, and in the morning took their farewel of the good Lady, who was almoſt become a natural Mother to <hi>Fortus,</hi> and ſhed a world

                     <hi>Then in the morning betimes we dreſſed our ſelves, and ſhe conveyed us ſo, that we were not at all perceived; and the night before, I cauſed Melcer to carry our horſes, and our cloathes when we were in bed, to a place in the City, where I commanded him to ſtay till I ſent for him. So we both came to the place where you were walking; and Madam, this I did, becauſe I would not be known to the Emperor to come onely to ſee the Queen my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe by that means I might get ſooner to Perſia again; and I was not able to ſtay all this time from you ſweet Cloryana: But, O Heavens!

                     <hi>But I had almoſt forgot to tell you, what fell out on Seas, as I came to Perſia; when we were gone a few leagues from the ſhoar, there we met with a famous Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, and he thought to have a prize of us, and ſo he came near and grapled with our ſhip; now ours was no man of War, but onely a Merchants Veſſel that I had hired</hi>

And when we had cauſed them all to yield, the Merchant and I went to the Pirats Veſſel, and in the mean time I left my Dwarf to the wounds of the Captain of the Pirats, who had the look of a brave man, and indeed was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Valiant perſon.

                     <hi>I went to the Lady, and humbly craved the cauſe of her diſcontent.

            <p>It being dark, and he ſéeking for his ſword, in his deſpair would have killed himſelf: But there appeared to him in a flame of Fire, the Goddeſt <hi>Venus,</hi> and with a Charming clear voyce, ſaid;</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Cleocreton</hi> was not at all diſmaid at the Viſton, for he was almoſt deſperate: And having none to comfort him but his own Love tormenting heart, when the Viſion was gone, he ſaid, <hi>Well, the Gods do not ceaſe to promiſe fair things, no more then they ceaſe to torment me.

            </p>
            <p>So with theſe reſolutions of patience, he then ſuffered the needful Meſſenger of ſleep, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> up, and viewing it very well, ſaw that it was the Pourtraicture of <hi>Cloryana;</hi> ſo he then imagined his grief, for he was well read in the Book of Love himſelf, and greatly pitied his Brother, but not to of cover what he knew, becauſe <hi>Cleocreton</hi> did never ſelf it him.</p>
            <p>So he went ſoftly to the door, and then ruſting in, <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creton</hi> awaked, and ſeeing the Picture, he hid it, and ſaid, <hi>Who is there? Fortus</hi> ſaid, <hi>It is I Brother; ſurely you have entertained ſome pleaſant dream, you love your bed ſo well this morning.</hi> Now he ſaid this, to try what he would ſay, <hi>Brother, you look as though you were poſſeſſed with melancholy Love.</hi> He anſwered, <hi>Nay, rather over ſlept my ſelf Brother,</hi> ſaid he. Well thought <hi>Fortus,</hi> I know more then you think I do.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Cleocreton</hi> called for his Cloaths, and as though he would tura his inſide outwards, he would wear black that day; now it was fine cloth, cut in many ſlaſhes and opens, ſhewing his pure linnen, and upon many of the opens was ſet claſpes of Diamonds, nobly ſhewing their luſtre on his arms and body, and giving the more occaſion for his fair hair to ſhew its golden treaſure. So he being ready, went out to the other Princely Company; for <hi>Perſia</hi> was never ſo plentifully furniſhed with ſo Noble Gueſts as now.</p>
            <p>It being a pleaſant morning, the Emperor would needs ſhew the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Hungary</hi> his fine Garden, and curious marks.

O, Madam (ſaid he) I am extremely troubled to think that now I muſt leave you again, and know not how in all the world to do; for I muſt not ſtay in Perſia after my Father, and being once gone, what ſhall I do? O Heavens direct me! Why, (ſaid ſhe) I have more hopes, that the Gods will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:153076:42"/>
               <hi>what they have promiſed, and give us more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. But certainly Madam (ſaid he) I admire that you ſhould be ſo patient, for it is ſo inſufferable to me, that I can ſcarce believe either Gods or men; for though I had a promiſe from the Goddeſs Venus, yet I know not how my afflictions ſhould end; for without the enjoyment of my dear Lady, they are ſtill greater. Well (ſaid the Princeſs) if it be determined by my Father, that I muſt marry the Calydon Prince, then comfort thy ſelf, my Cleocreton, and expect me in ſome ſtrange habit; for falſe I will not be to Cleocreton, upon any account what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover. Oh (ſaid Cleocreton, even raviſhed with joy to hear her Words) Madam, I am well recompenced, though I ſpend my hearts blood to win ſo rare a Princeſs.</hi> But <hi>Philopeet</hi> was not ſo pleaſed with her Gallant, whoſe head was ſo troubled to think of the cruelty of his Lady <hi>Freeſa,</hi> that he ſcarce had the leaſt thought of the Lady whom he led, entertaining her with little or no diſcourſe; therefore ſhe had no great eſtimation of his Courtly carriage.</p>
            <p>Thus they walked thorow all the ſpacious Gardens and Walks: Now in the midſt of the higheſt Garden, was a clear Chryſtal Fountain, walled in with Alabaſter, by which they paſſed, and ſo went into a large gréen Arbour, richly covered, by reaſon it was Summer tune; and there they reſted on rich Cuſhions, laid for the purpoſe in chairs; and on one ſide of the Arbor was a door, which was of double gla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Then the Emperors great care was, to get a Valiant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to lead his Army in the War, for he could not deſire <hi>Albyazer</hi> to ſupply that place, becauſe he was but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So he (being General) and a Coſin of the Empreſſes, whoſe name was <hi>Moriſco,</hi> and <hi>Preuhoun,</hi> with many other young Lords and Knights of <hi>Perſia,</hi> prepared for the War, and there was a mighty Army levied.

            <p>Great ſearching was made up and down for him by his Brother <hi>Fortus,</hi> but all was in vain, for no intelligence was to be had of him, but they were all glad to go on their journey: And when they came into <hi>Hungary,</hi> every one in general did greatly applaud the valour of invincible <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creton,</hi> which made all to be more ſenſible of their loſs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the good King and Queen; but the Quéen though ſhe concealed it, yet ſhe did ſuſpect that he was gone to <hi>Cloryana,</hi> which did the more quiet her.</p>

               </gap> to go out with her, and they both went near the Sea ſide, and to the top of a Rock ſhe climbed, and from thence ſhe received her deaths kiſs, at the botom of the Sea: Her Maid was not willing to ſee her underneath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the carrier of this monſtrous news to the good King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> which ſtreight broke his heart, and ſo he reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Kingdom to the Iſſue of his Siſter the Queen: of <hi>Hungary;</hi> which fell to the ſhare of <hi>Cleocreton,</hi> who was in great diſtreſs, for his hopes was all gone concerning his dear <hi>Cloryana;</hi> for he heard nothing from her, but onely of her mirth and health.</p>
            <p>Then he was willing to expire, and getting the habit of a Pilgrim, went to the Court of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and there he two days behe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now one day it fell out, that the Emperor, and all the Ladies of the Court, was at the ſport of fiſhing at the Lible River; and <hi>Cleocreton</hi> going on the other ſide, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Thou bold Caitiff, how dareſt thou put thy leau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſtaff in the Brook, when the Emperor is taking his pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Pilgrim gave no heed to what he ſaid, but kept on his poſture: The fellow began to be angry, and laid his hand on his ſword, ſayin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:153076:55"/>
               <hi>Surely thou ſhalt be taught ſome manners, if thou didſt bring none hither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And having ſaid ſo, he preſently ſtruck the Pilgrim on the breaſt, with the pummel of his ſword. The Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim bring grieved at the Impudence of the Fellow, be drew out his ſword from under his gown, and gave him a ſore remembrance: The fellow almoſt mad to ſee the courage of the Pilgrim, and therefore with all his might be aimed at the head of the Pilgrim, who had one of his féet in the water, and the other on the graſs, which was juſt over againſt the Emperor.</p>
            <p>Then the Pilgrim could not well wave the ſtroke, and therefore the weapon of the other, cleft his Helmet in two pieces, which fell down, and ſhewed his golden hair to the beholders; who were all ſtruck with aſtoniſhment, when they well perceived it was none but Noble <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperor was even rapt up in any and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Lords to take away the fellow, whom he had given many ſore wounds too. Then the people ſwarmed about <hi>Cleocreton,</hi> and ſweet <hi>Cloryana</hi> had all the content that a perſon ſo long from her love could have. When he came over the River, the Emperor imbraced him, and ſaid, <hi>Welcome a thouſand times, valiant Cleocreton.</hi> But when he came to <hi>Cloryana,</hi> O Gods, none knows the joys of them hoth, but ſuch that have been debarred from the thing they moſt eſteem: when they enjoy it again, then ſurely there is nothing but the extremily of that Paſſion muſt fall out.</p>
            <p>Now the next day following, muſt be the day when there two Lovers muſt of ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll adde more luſtre and perfection, to the incomparable Beauty of Heavenly <hi>Cloryana;</hi> whoſe eyes rather invited the Gods to be her gueſts, then her Fathes mortal Subjects.</p>
            <p>Then followed the other Bride, which was Lady <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey;</hi> but <hi>Cloryana</hi> firſt paid her Rites to the God <hi>Hyman.</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:153076:55"/>
The Emperor took her by the hand, and gave her to the Invincible <hi>Cleocreton,</hi> ſaying,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now behold your King, my Friends and Subjects, who is the Emperor of all the Land of Perſia, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, and Tunis; reſpect him as your lawful Prince, and worthy of all Renown; and as one that is able to defend your Rites, and Lives, and Liberties, from all foreign aſſaults.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which ſaid, the people almoſt cauſed the Earth to ſhake, by the reaſon of their joy, ſhouts, and praices, and acclamations, in, and to the glory of <hi>Cleocreton</hi> and <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryana.</hi> And then came the turn of <hi>Muxorb</hi> and <hi>Calſey,</hi> whoſe joy was no leſs then the others.</p>
            <p>And thus they both enjoyed their Ladies; and in ſhort time, the Emperor yielded all his Regal Power and Riches to his Son <hi>Cleocreton;</hi> and the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> did the ſame, enforced by the common Adverſary death, and left <hi>Cleocreton</hi> in the height of pleaſure and content, to enjoy his beautiful Empreſs <hi>Cloryana.</hi>
